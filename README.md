**[Download MicroDino.ahk](https://github.com/DavidBevi/MicroDino/releases/download/v0.3/MicroDino.ahk)** for Windows<br><br>
Micro Dino is a simple and super-light (<3kb) game inspired by Dino Run, the game inside Google Chrome. <br> 
I made Micro Dino for myself, to help me pass the time when I wait for an email, or something similar.<br>
You can change screen position (you most likely need to do so >> see CUSTOMIZATION below).<br>
You can also remap the controls (same method).<br>
<b>COMMANDS</b>: Hold Ctrl to run the game, while doing that press Shift to jump.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>HOW TO INSTALL:</b> MicroDino.ahk is a script made to be executed by AutoHotkey v2.0<br>
1. Download the program (AutoHotkey) here >> www.autohotkey.com (VERSION 2.0)<br>
2. Download my script (MicroDino.ahk) and open it (double click)<br>
3. <i>Have fun!</i> ☻
</p>

<p>
<b>CUSTOMIZATION:</b> Open MicroDino.ahk with any text editor (like Notepad) to easily:<br>
 - customize the position on your screen by editing "PosX" and "PosY"<br>
 - customize the commands (refer to www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Tutorial.htm for instructions)<br>
 (Remember to save your edits before closing the file!)<br>
<i>You can customize everything if you know what you're doing, do so if you want!</i> :P
</p><br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
<b>ALTERNATIVE</b>: MicroDino.exe, is a standalone portable executable, but <b>please notice</b> that it's v0.3,  you CANNOT customize the position/controls <b>yet</b>. I'll compile it asap. <b>Use it at your own risk.</b>
