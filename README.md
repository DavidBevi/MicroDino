**[Download MicroDino.ahk](https://github.com/DavidBevi/MicroDino/releases/download/v0.3/MicroDino.ahk)**<br><br>
Micro Dino is a simple and light game inspired by Dino Run, the game inside Google Chrome. <br> 
I made Micro Dino for myself, to help me pass the time when I wait for an email, or something similar.<br>
You can change screen position (you most likely need to do so >> see CUSTOMIZATION below).<br>
You can also remap the controls (same method).<br>
<b>COMMANDS</b>: Hold Ctrl to run the game, while doing that press Shift to jump.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>HOW TO INSTALL:</b> MicroDino.ahk is a script made to be executed by AutoHotkey v2.0<br>
1. Download the program (AutoHotkey) here >> www.autohotkey.com (VERSION 2.0)<br>
2. Download my script (MicroDino.ahk) and open it (double click)<br>
3. <i>Have fun!</i> â˜»
</p>

<p>
<b>CUSTOMIZATION:</b> Open MicroDino.ahk with any text editor (like Notepad) to easily:<br>
 - customize the position on your screen by editing "PosX" and "PosY"<br>
 - customize the commands (refer to www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Tutorial.htm for instructions)<br>
 (Remember to save your edits before closing the file!)<br>
<i>You can customize everything if you know what you're doing, do so if you want!</i> :P
</p><br>

<p>
<b>ALTERNATIVE</b>: I'm sharing MicroDino.exe, which is a standalone portable executable, but <b>please notice:</b><br>
 - You CANNOT customize the position on your screen<br>
 - You CANNOT customize the controls<br>
This executable works well on my PC but it's probably off-screen on yours. <b>Use it at your own risk.</b>
