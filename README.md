▼ INFO: Micro Dino is a little game inspired by Dino Run.
I made it for myself to help me pass the time when I wait for an email, or something similar.
I let it live in my taskbar, but you can set your desired position by editing PosX and PosY.
You obviously can also remap the controls. Have fun!
  - COMMANDS: it uses one key (Ctrl) to run the simulation and another one (Shift) to jump.


▼ HOW TO PLAY: MicroDino.ahk is a script made to be executed by AutoHotkey v2.0 
1. Download the program here >> www.autohotkey.com (VERSION 2.0)
2. Then download MicroDino.ahk and open it
  By editing my file you can easily:
  - customize the position on your screen
  - customize the controls
  You can customize everything actually, do so if you want! :P
► I suggest you to use it this! ◄

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
▼ ALTERNATIVE: MicroDino.exe is a standalone portable executable. Please notice:
 - You CANNOT customize the position on your screen
 - You CANNOT customize the controls
It's aligned well on my PC, probably it's off-screen on yours. Use it at your own risk.
