<b>MicroDino</b> is a simple game for Windows, inspired by Dino Run. <br> 
It's designed to stay over the taskbar, because I made it to kill time in short burst, when I'm waiting for an email or something similar.<br>

**DOWNLOADS**:
- [MicroDino_v2.exe](https://github.com/DavidBevi/MicroDino/releases/download/v2/MicroDino_v2.exe) (portable, self-contained app) &nbsp; > &nbsp; just open it and play!
- [MicroDino_v2.ahk](https://github.com/DavidBevi/MicroDino/releases/download/v2/MicroDino_v2.ahk) (script, needs [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com)) &nbsp; > &nbsp; persistent high-score, editable

**COMMANDS**: Hold Ctrl to run the game, while doing that press Shift to jump.<br>

**CUSTOMIZATION:** Open MicroDino.ahk with any text editor (like Notepad) to edit it.
